# A manifesto for agile (data) science

> Parentheses indicate that pretty much all science *is* data science,
since management of data is essential and integral to the labor of
scientists.

To fix the reproducibility and replicability crisis of modern science,
and reduce the anxiety and bad career prospects of researchers,
science needs to follow the path of software development and become
[agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

Here is a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12545) and a
[presentation](ac-ds.html) to justify a set of new hypotheses that
would improve the situation of science. They're open to suggestions,
just open a pull request.

To fix the reproducibility and replicability crisis of modern science, and reduce the anxiety and bad career prospects of researchers, science needs to follow the path of software development and become agile.


## Hypotheses

1. Reproducibility over publishability
2. Testing at all levels over hypotheses proved once
3. Open over closed
4. Stakeholder collaboration over vertical chains-of-command
