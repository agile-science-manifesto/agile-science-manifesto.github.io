# A manifesto for agile data science

To fix the reproducibility and replicability crisis of modern science, and reduce the anxiety and bad career prospects of researchers, science needs to follow the path of software development and become agile.

Here is a [paper](agile.html) and a [presentation](ac-ds.html) to justify a set of new hypotheses that would improve the situation of science. They're open to suggestions, just open a pull request.

## Hypotheses

1. Reproducibility over publishability
2. Testing at all levels over hypotheses proved once
3. Open over closed
4. Stakeholder collaboration over vertical chains-of-command
